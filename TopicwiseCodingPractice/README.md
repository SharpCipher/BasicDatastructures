# Datastructures and Algorithms

Welcome to the world of DSA and Problem solving. In this section, we are focusing on imoproving all (most of the) Datastructures and their applications topic wise. On the go,
we cover few Algorithms and applications.

The main objective here is getting a good understanding of all the Datastructures and improving problem solving skills and the application of these in real world problems.

## Coding, Coding, and Keep Coding

My main motto is to improve the logical and problem solving skills, to become better one step at a time. As a Software Engineer, I always enjoy a bit of fresh learnings...
Keep Coding and Enjoy the journey!!

**Coming to this Folder structure...** <br/>
I tried to solve as many problems, different types, covering all the concepts of different Datastructures. Each folder, specific to one particular DS, starts with some basic
problems that uses the constructs/features of that DS, slowly goes to some intermediate to advanced programming problems.

While I keep my learning journey as consistent as possible, I also aim to focus on improvement at both concept and application levels.

I'll keep adding more and more as my journey to become a better coder and better version of myself goes on.


Keep coding!!
