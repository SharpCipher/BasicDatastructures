/*
Given an integer array X[] of size n, write a program to find all the leaders in the array X[].
An element is a leader if it is strictly greater than all the elements to its right side.

The last element of an array is a leader by default.
The largest element of an array is also a leader by default.
Suppose all the array elements are unique.
Ordering in the output doesnâ€™t matter.

Example 1
Input: X[] = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2], Output: [17, 5, 2]
Explanation: Element 2 is the rightmost element, so it is a leader by default. 17 and 5 are also leader
elements because they are greater than all the elements on their right side.

Example 2
Input: X[] = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1], Output: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Explanation: All elements are leaders because they are greater than all the elements on their right side.
Element 1 is the rightmost element, so it is a leader by default.

Example 3
Input: X[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], Output: [6]
Explanation: Element 6 is the rightmost element, which is a leader by default. Otherwise, all elements are
less than all on their right side.
